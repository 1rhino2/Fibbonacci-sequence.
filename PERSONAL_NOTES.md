# Personal Notes on Fibonacci

## My Learning Process

I started with the classic coding interview problem, but got interested in the math behind it. There’s something satisfying about seeing how different algorithms approach the same sequence, and how the math connects with things outside of pure calculation.

## What I Learned

- Recursive code is neat, but not practical for big numbers.
- Dynamic programming and memoization are much faster, and Python makes memoization easy.
- The closed-form (Binet’s formula) feels almost magical, though it loses accuracy for very large n.

## Things I’m Still Wondering About

- Is the prevalence of Fibonacci numbers in nature as strong as people say?
- Matrix exponentiation is fast, but I’m still working on understanding why it works so well.
- Are there other sequences that “hide” in plain sight like Fibonacci does?

## Next Steps

- Try visualizing more patterns and ratios.
- Look into related sequences (like Lucas numbers).
- Maybe explore Fibonacci applications in algorithms beyond just generating the sequence.
