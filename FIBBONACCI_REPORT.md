## 1. Introduction

The Fibonacci sequence is deceptively simple, but it’s one of those topics where the more you dig, the more interesting stories you find—both in math and in the real world.

## 2. Proofs and Derivations

### Recursive Definition

The sequence is defined by F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.  
Proof by induction works naturally here, and it’s always a good exercise to write it out.

### Binet’s Formula

The closed-form equation is:

F(n) = (φ^n - ψ^n) / √5,  
where φ = (1 + √5)/2 and ψ = (1 - √5)/2.

It’s still surprising to me that this actually produces exact integers (up to floating-point precision).

### Some Properties

- The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers is F(n+2) - 1.  
- The sum of the squares of the first n Fibonacci numbers is F(n) * F(n+1).

## 3. Visualizations

### Simple Spiral Representation (ASCII)

```

(Not the best, but it gives an idea.)

### Growth Plot

If you plot the sequence, the numbers increase exponentially. The ratio F(n+1)/F(n) converges quickly to the golden ratio.

## 4. Applications and Patterns

- **In Nature:** Commonly cited examples are the arrangement of leaves, seeds, and shells. Sometimes I think the connection is a bit overstated, but it’s definitely interesting to look for these patterns.
- **In Computing:** The sequence is a classic example for recursion, dynamic programming, and even data structures like the Fibonacci heap.
- **In Art and Design:** The golden ratio, which is connected to Fibonacci, appears in art, architecture, and design. I see it mentioned a lot, though I’m not always convinced of its universality.

## 5. Questions and Open Thoughts

- How much of Fibonacci’s appearance in nature is real, and how much is us looking for patterns?
- Why is the convergence to the golden ratio so fast?
- What other recursive sequences have similar properties?
- How do generalizations like the Lucas sequence compare?

This document is a work in progress; as I learn more, I plan to add to these notes.
